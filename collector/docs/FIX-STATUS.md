# Fix status — what is written, what is on production, what is proven

Companion to `docs/FIXLIST-2026-09-05.md`, which says what is *wrong*. This says
what has been *done* about it, and — the column that matters — how the claim was
checked. Started 2026-09-05.

The point of this file is that "fixed" is four different states and conflating
them is how a dashboard ends up telling you something it stopped being able to
prove. So each row carries all four:

| state | what it means |
|---|---|
| **written** | the code is changed and the suite is green |
| **committed** | it is on `claude/ecosine-egari-tracking-apis-rf9ong` |
| **deployed** | it is running on `fleet-dashboard-wpeqb.ondigitalocean.app` |
| **proven** | re-measured on production *after* the deploy, by the same method that found it |

A row is only finished at **proven**. `written` on its own is a hypothesis; the
suite passing tells you the tests agree with the code, not that the code agrees
with the fleet.

## Batch 1 — anonymous callers were served driver identity documents

Commits `6bfe0e3`, `1084cbf`, `4304ad4`. **Proven on production 2026-09-05**, by
curl carrying no cookie, no header and no token — the same way the leak was found.

| # | what | proof |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | `/api/trip` served the hotel provider's record verbatim | bcrypt `$2b$10$…`, `784-1999-8885500-5` and `ExponentPushToken[…]` all absent; `raw._redacted` names the three paths taken |
| C16 | the same credentials were *stored*, not just served | `sql/schema_v59.sql` ran; stored rows scrubbed, `schema_once` row present |
| C12 | `/api/compliance/drivers` — 123 Emirates IDs, 94 licence numbers | both keys absent, `identity_withheld` names them, reason given |
| C12 | `/api/schema/raw-values` sampled provider records | clean on `driver` and `driverInfo` |
| C12 | `/api/export/trips.csv` — 265,739 rows with addresses | `(withheld)` in both address columns |
| — | `/api/probe/results` sampled secrets | withheld sentinel, distinct counts kept |
| — | **`/api/driver/profile` — a fifth route the audit missed** | keys absent, `identity_held` reports the papers exist |

The fifth route is the one worth remembering. It answers for **one named
person** rather than a list, which is the shape somebody actually wants, and it
survived the first fix because `IDENTITY_DOCS` lived inside a single route in
`api/server.js` while this route lives in `api/driver_routes.js`. The definition
now lives in `api/redact.js` and both import it. **If you add a route that
selects `licence_no` or `emirates_id`, import `stripIdentity` — do not re-derive
the list.**

What deliberately survives redaction, because the operator asked for it in as
many words: **phone, email, picture, name, licence expiry, days-left**. A
security fix that deletes those is a broken page wearing a badge.

Screenshots, desktop and mobile: driver card reads `LICENCE withheld · EMIRATES
ID withheld` beside the phone number; compliance table's two columns read
WITHHELD with the reason above; hotel trip page states "1 field withheld:
`car.licenseNumber`" over a record carrying `_redacted` and no values.

### Still open in this batch, by instruction

`api/admin_gate.js` fails **open** when `ADMIN_TOKEN` is unset, which is this
instance. Held that way deliberately — "don't bother with token, we need to test
everything before we create security fixes". The read side is redacted anyway, so
the cost is bounded. **To close it: set `ADMIN_TOKEN` on the API component
first, confirm it, then delete the `if (!configured)` branch. Variable first,
code second — the other order is a lockout.**

## Batch 2 — the eleven small criticals

Commits `c034bb1` (round one), `7971589` (the refutations), `a72e71b` (a page
that could not load). **Proven on production 2026-09-05**, each by the
measurement that found it.

| # | what it did | re-measured after the deploy |
|---|---|---|
| C2/C15 | dragging 240→300 days took fleet income from AED 2.75M to **8.89M**, silently changing the figure's meaning from net payout to gross fare | 300d now AED 2.99M, uber `basis=partial_payout` holding its real payout 2,319,203.89. The cliff is gone at 240, 300 and 365 |
| C3 | `/api/kpis` divided by calendar days, so the picker made "Money in" read AED 168,213 against a true 125,189 | kpis and revenue agree **to the cent** on both windows tested — 148,340.39 and 499,453.53 |
| C4 | 45 of 98 plates reported Uber's gross as the car's income, AED 64,548.64 above the ledger | 40 plates swept: **0** still report fares while holding a payout |
| C5 | `#causes` said FMS fell 97% into January when it rose 15%; the KPI tile and the cards below disagreed | 34 → **25** stored rows; tile and panel now both read +1,029% Mar 25 → Apr 25 |
| C6 | every chip read 25,907 online hours byte-identical; Bolt was called 99% idle on a feed that does not exist | ecosine 17,274 + egari 8,633 = 25,907 exactly; **Bolt renders an em-dash and "never collected here"** |
| C7 | the provenance page said "No provider sent a figure for this window" for 112s of every 900s | **176 consecutive samples across a live rebuild**, never once blank or partial |
| C8 | `#causes` and `#forecast` disagreed about Dec 2024, flipping the page's central conclusion | Dec 24 now partial with 13 days; the two telematics-only months report `days_in_record: null` |
| C9 | 31 working vehicles showed "0 per 100 km" in the tone reserved for good news | **26 of 26** untracked plates render absent with the reason |
| C10 | a Yango trip page printed AED 342.05 as Yango's net on a day whose Yango fares were AED 66.00 | yango, bolt and hotel all `statement_day: null`; uber keeps its own, now with `period_days: 7` |
| C11 | the headline read AED 384,266 over a Gap tile reading 117,766, on one screen | banner and tile agree — 6 months, delta 117,588.87, and the 2 excluded months are named |

18 of 18 pages render with no console error.

### What the adversarial verifiers were worth

Round one's eight lanes were each read by a verifier told to refute rather than
confirm. **Two succeeded**, and both had found a regression introduced *by a
fix*: C8's span narrowing made a `Math.max(1, …)` clamp reachable so a
telematics-only month claimed "1 of 31 days collected", and C10's new caption
asserted the provider filed nothing on 175,105 Uber bookings where the truth is
that we do not reach back that far. Neither was caught by any test.

Round two answered both, and its own verifiers found six more — almost all of
one kind: **a figure correctly made absent and then given a reason that is not
true.** A caption sending readers to `#reconcile` to see a comparison that page
deliberately does not perform. `?? 0` printing "0 of the 31 days Uber worked"
for coverage that is unknown. A future window told its days "cannot be
backfilled". `/payout/` matching the new `zero_payout` basis, so a channel paid
nothing was named among those that reported paying.

### And the one the tests could not have caught

`#supply?platform=bolt` — the exact page the chip fix was written for —
rendered **"COULD NOT LOAD THIS VIEW · noFeed is not defined"** while 30
assertions passed green. The tests drove the route; nothing drove the page.
Found by screenshotting production after the deploy. The file now carries a
thirty-first assertion that every local the module reads is declared in it,
verified by reintroducing the dangling name and watching it fail.

**A suite passing tells you the tests agree with the code. Only a screenshot
tells you the page renders.**

## `docs/COVERAGE.md` — two corrections

Commit `80ddcad`. Both were mine, both written the day before, and both pointed
the same way: at giving up.

- **Retention is ~17.6 months, not ~12.** Measured, not read off documentation:
  `PAYMENTS_ORDER` accepts a window opening `2025-03-17` and refuses
  `2025-03-16`. The `~12mo` note at the head of `src/sources/uber.js` was where
  the wrong figure came from and is corrected there too.
- **Which makes Apr–Aug 2025 a bug, not a ceiling.** Those months are *inside*
  retention. The 60–97% fare coverage is eight payments weeks Uber generated
  successfully and we timed out downloading — `download timed out after 600s for
  report <uuid>`, `src/sources/uber.js:137`. The reportId is discarded inside
  the error string and the failure is not checkpointed, so **every Sunday
  backfill burns ~80 minutes and eight of its three-at-a-time report slots
  re-failing the same eight windows**. Roughly 13,800 Ecosine bookings and some
  AED 700k of fares are recoverable by a retry that keeps the reportId.

The row that read *"permanently | nothing — past retention"* is the sentence
that made this true for a year. Both corrections are marked as corrections
rather than quietly rewritten, for that reason.

## Not started

- **Batch 3** — the medium and large criticals: the `refreshStatements`
  `resolved`-CTE supersession (settles C13, C19 and C25 in one change), the
  phantom `occupancy_segment` rows (C14, 59.6% of the table), the unauthorised
  Yango veto (C17), the `#unit` asset-ledger fleet filter (C23), the identity
  fold (C24), and the CABMAN 132-phantom-plate denominator (C18).
- **Batch 4+** — the 118 highs, grouped by the seven root causes in
  `FIXLIST-2026-09-05.md`.
- **The latency work** — `POST /v1/vehicle-suppliers/transactions` is issued as
  a **GET** by all three probes, gets a 404, and is recorded as "the provider has
  nothing". It is the surface that publishes per-trip money at sub-minute
  freshness, on a scope `src/config.js:125` already requests.

## How to re-check any row here without re-reading the audit

Every proof in the Batch 1 table is a single anonymous curl with `&_=$RANDOM`
appended (the API caches; without the buster you will read the answer from
before the deploy). The screenshots come from `bin/prod-mirror.mjs` on :8200 —
Chromium in this sandbox has no route to the internet, so a browser pointed at
production returns `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` and the mirror is what makes a real
screenshot of production possible at all.

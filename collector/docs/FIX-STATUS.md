# Fix status — what is written, what is on production, what is proven

Companion to `docs/FIXLIST-2026-09-05.md`, which says what is *wrong*. This says
what has been *done* about it, and — the column that matters — how the claim was
checked. Started 2026-09-05.

The point of this file is that "fixed" is four different states and conflating
them is how a dashboard ends up telling you something it stopped being able to
prove. So each row carries all four:

| state | what it means |
|---|---|
| **written** | the code is changed and the suite is green |
| **committed** | it is on `claude/ecosine-egari-tracking-apis-rf9ong` |
| **deployed** | it is running on `fleet-dashboard-wpeqb.ondigitalocean.app` |
| **proven** | re-measured on production *after* the deploy, by the same method that found it |

A row is only finished at **proven**. `written` on its own is a hypothesis; the
suite passing tells you the tests agree with the code, not that the code agrees
with the fleet.

## Batch 1 — anonymous callers were served driver identity documents

Commits `6bfe0e3`, `1084cbf`, `4304ad4`. **Proven on production 2026-09-05**, by
curl carrying no cookie, no header and no token — the same way the leak was found.

| # | what | proof |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | `/api/trip` served the hotel provider's record verbatim | bcrypt `$2b$10$…`, `784-1999-8885500-5` and `ExponentPushToken[…]` all absent; `raw._redacted` names the three paths taken |
| C16 | the same credentials were *stored*, not just served | `sql/schema_v59.sql` ran; stored rows scrubbed, `schema_once` row present |
| C12 | `/api/compliance/drivers` — 123 Emirates IDs, 94 licence numbers | both keys absent, `identity_withheld` names them, reason given |
| C12 | `/api/schema/raw-values` sampled provider records | clean on `driver` and `driverInfo` |
| C12 | `/api/export/trips.csv` — 265,739 rows with addresses | `(withheld)` in both address columns |
| — | `/api/probe/results` sampled secrets | withheld sentinel, distinct counts kept |
| — | **`/api/driver/profile` — a fifth route the audit missed** | keys absent, `identity_held` reports the papers exist |

The fifth route is the one worth remembering. It answers for **one named
person** rather than a list, which is the shape somebody actually wants, and it
survived the first fix because `IDENTITY_DOCS` lived inside a single route in
`api/server.js` while this route lives in `api/driver_routes.js`. The definition
now lives in `api/redact.js` and both import it. **If you add a route that
selects `licence_no` or `emirates_id`, import `stripIdentity` — do not re-derive
the list.**

What deliberately survives redaction, because the operator asked for it in as
many words: **phone, email, picture, name, licence expiry, days-left**. A
security fix that deletes those is a broken page wearing a badge.

Screenshots, desktop and mobile: driver card reads `LICENCE withheld · EMIRATES
ID withheld` beside the phone number; compliance table's two columns read
WITHHELD with the reason above; hotel trip page states "1 field withheld:
`car.licenseNumber`" over a record carrying `_redacted` and no values.

### Still open in this batch, by instruction

`api/admin_gate.js` fails **open** when `ADMIN_TOKEN` is unset, which is this
instance. Held that way deliberately — "don't bother with token, we need to test
everything before we create security fixes". The read side is redacted anyway, so
the cost is bounded. **To close it: set `ADMIN_TOKEN` on the API component
first, confirm it, then delete the `if (!configured)` branch. Variable first,
code second — the other order is a lockout.**

## Batch 2 — the eleven small criticals

Commit `c034bb1`. **written + committed. NOT deployed, and deliberately so.**

Eight lanes over disjoint files, each read afterwards by an adversarial verifier
told to refute rather than confirm. Six could not refute; **two could**, and both
refutations are regressions introduced *by a fix* rather than surviving one:

- **C8** — narrowing the trend's partiality span to the booking record made a
  pre-existing `Math.max(1, dayDiff(…))` clamp reachable. A month holding only
  telematics now reports `partial_month=true, days_in_record=1`, and `#causes`
  renders "1 of 31 days collected" beside "0 bookings, 6,960 telematics
  journeys". False under either reading. **No test catches it** — `causes.js`
  filters the supply thirds on `trips > 0`.
- **C10** — the new caption says the channel "filed no statement covering this
  day" on every Uber trip older than the components horizon. The horizon starts
  around Feb 2026 and 167,007 bookings sit before it. Uber filed plenty; *we*
  do not reach back that far. The same sentence prints on 1,944 FMS telematics
  journeys that name no driver at all.

Six more verifiers could not refute but found real falsehoods, the sharpest
being one the fix itself introduced: the supply predicates sit in the `ev` CTE
**ahead of** the `lead()` window, so they remove rows before the span is formed
and a driver whose closing event belongs to another fleet gets a wrong span.

Round two is answering all of it. **Nothing from this batch reaches production
until the refutations are closed** — a fix that trades a wrong number for a
wrong sentence has not fixed anything.

### The lesson this batch keeps teaching

Three round-one lanes broke a test that was pinned to a **value** rather than a
property — `licence_no === 'AE99'`, `licence_no === 'DL-77'`, a mock fixture
missing a new key. And one round-one lane shipped an assertion that **passes
with the fix reverted**, which is not an assertion at all. Both failure modes
are now in every lane brief: *pin the property, and prove the assertion bites by
reverting.*

## `docs/COVERAGE.md` — two corrections

Commit `80ddcad`. Both were mine, both written the day before, and both pointed
the same way: at giving up.

- **Retention is ~17.6 months, not ~12.** Measured, not read off documentation:
  `PAYMENTS_ORDER` accepts a window opening `2025-03-17` and refuses
  `2025-03-16`. The `~12mo` note at the head of `src/sources/uber.js` was where
  the wrong figure came from and is corrected there too.
- **Which makes Apr–Aug 2025 a bug, not a ceiling.** Those months are *inside*
  retention. The 60–97% fare coverage is eight payments weeks Uber generated
  successfully and we timed out downloading — `download timed out after 600s for
  report <uuid>`, `src/sources/uber.js:137`. The reportId is discarded inside
  the error string and the failure is not checkpointed, so **every Sunday
  backfill burns ~80 minutes and eight of its three-at-a-time report slots
  re-failing the same eight windows**. Roughly 13,800 Ecosine bookings and some
  AED 700k of fares are recoverable by a retry that keeps the reportId.

The row that read *"permanently | nothing — past retention"* is the sentence
that made this true for a year. Both corrections are marked as corrections
rather than quietly rewritten, for that reason.

## Not started

- **Batch 3** — the medium and large criticals: the `refreshStatements`
  `resolved`-CTE supersession (settles C13, C19 and C25 in one change), the
  phantom `occupancy_segment` rows (C14, 59.6% of the table), the unauthorised
  Yango veto (C17), the `#unit` asset-ledger fleet filter (C23), the identity
  fold (C24), and the CABMAN 132-phantom-plate denominator (C18).
- **Batch 4+** — the 118 highs, grouped by the seven root causes in
  `FIXLIST-2026-09-05.md`.
- **The latency work** — `POST /v1/vehicle-suppliers/transactions` is issued as
  a **GET** by all three probes, gets a 404, and is recorded as "the provider has
  nothing". It is the surface that publishes per-trip money at sub-minute
  freshness, on a scope `src/config.js:125` already requests.

## How to re-check any row here without re-reading the audit

Every proof in the Batch 1 table is a single anonymous curl with `&_=$RANDOM`
appended (the API caches; without the buster you will read the answer from
before the deploy). The screenshots come from `bin/prod-mirror.mjs` on :8200 —
Chromium in this sandbox has no route to the internet, so a browser pointed at
production returns `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` and the mirror is what makes a real
screenshot of production possible at all.
